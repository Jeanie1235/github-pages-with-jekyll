Today, I decided to bake one of my favorite desserts: brown butter chocolate chip cookies. This recipe does not require a bunch of ingredients and one extra step makes
a world of a difference. I like to be extra fancy and chop up some Ghiridelli chocolate bars instead of using chocolate chips as well.
